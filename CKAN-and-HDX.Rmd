## HDX

I've updated this on 04/06/17. My initial attempts to understand the HDX CKAN database are now in the markdown file CKAN-and-HDX.

My newer thoughts of how to approach this are in a (blogpost)[https://callumgwtaylor.github.io/blog/2017/06/04/getting-data-from-humanitarian-data-exchange-in-a-reproducible-r-pipeline/]

The functions that I made are in the file hum-functions.
